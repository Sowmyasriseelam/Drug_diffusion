## 📄 Drug Diffusion Simulation Report: HA vs Titanium

---

### ✅ **Material 1: Hydroxyapatite (HA)**
- **Type:** Ceramic biomaterial  
- **Common Use:** Bone grafts, orthopedic coatings  
- **Diffusion Coefficient (D):** ~1 × 10⁻¹² cm²/s  
- **Simulation Parameters:**
  - **Length (L):** 1.0 cm  
  - **Simulation Time (T):** 1000 s  
  - **Time Step (dt):** 10 s  
  - **Spatial Resolution (Nx):** 100  

#### 🔬 Behavior:
- Moderate diffusion rate — much slower than in polymers but still visible over time.
- **Drug gradually moves from the source**, forming a smooth gradient across the HA matrix.
- Suitable for **slow-release drug delivery**, especially in bone-targeting applications.
- The **cumulative drug release curve** shows a **gradual increase** over time.

### 🛑 **Material 2: Titanium (Ti)**
- **Type:** Metal  
- **Common Use:** Orthopedic and dental implants  
- **Diffusion Coefficient (D):** ~1 × 10⁻¹⁶ cm²/s  
- **Simulation Parameters:**
  - Same as for HA  

#### 🔬 Behavior:
- Extremely low diffusivity — drug essentially **does not penetrate** the matrix.
- Drug remains localized near the release boundary (x = 0).
- **Cumulative release curve is nearly flat**, showing no significant release over time.
- Titanium is **not suitable** for drug diffusion purposes, but useful as a barrier or support structure.

| Property                     | Hydroxyapatite (HA) | Titanium (Ti)          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Type                        | Ceramic             | Metal                  |
| Diffusion Coefficient (cm²/s) | ~1 × 10⁻¹²          | ~1 × 10⁻¹⁶             |
| Diffusion Behavior          | Slow but noticeable | Negligible             |
| Drug Delivery Suitability   | Good (slow release) | Not suitable (barrier) |

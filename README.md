# Drug_diffusion
To simulate and visualize how a drug diffuses through a polymeric biomaterial over time using the finite difference method (FDM), and allow users to customize simulation parameters through an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

This tool can help in:

Designing controlled drug delivery systems

Understanding how material or environmental factors affect release
